Organisational Principles : BadTeam
===================================

_Note that you can't use this directly. You should document your actual approach._
_It is worth trying to do this at the start of the project based on what you_
_plan to do, then updating at the end based on what you actually did._

Idea creation and selection
---------------------------

We decided to use a brain-storm then vote approach, in order to encourage
diversity and then get a coherent agreed direction:

1. Everyone reads the relevant documents/information (pre-meeting)
2. Independent brain-storming of solutions (pre-meeting)
3. Proposal of solutions (during meeting)
4. Public voting on best approach (during meeting)
5. ms24 acts as tie-breaker.
6. Decision recorded in shared document

Work allocation
---------------

Work is allocated according to priority, then preference:

1. All pending jobs/activities are listed.
2. Jobs are prioritised in the group.
3. Individuals express a preference for each task.
4. Any left-over tasks are assigned randomly.

Tools
-----

We primarily used drop-box to share documents. Conflicts were avoided through
an informal locking process, managed verbally in daily meetings.

Communication
-------------

Our main approach was to have a single 40 minute daily meeting on Zoom at a pre-agreed time,
regardless of who was working on that day. People with tasks to complete then worked
independently, and reported back at the next meeting. The list of tasks to complete was
reviewed, updated, and (re-)allocated at each meeting.

Sign-off
--------

gac19 volunteered to be the sign-off czar. They developed a check-list for preparing
the deliverables, and other people would send them updated versions for integration.
Our milestones are:

1. Deadline-3 : All documents complete. Package prepared by gac19 and circulated for review.
2. Deadline-2 : Minor changes based on feedback from individuals, plus agreement they have seen and approve
                the bundle. Final package prepared by gac 19, submitted, and circulated for sanity check.
3. Deadline-1 : If there are any final fixes, gac19 is notified, and final package updated and submitted.
