Organisational Principles : <HSBC>
===============================================

Idea creation and selection
---------------------------

<Methods used for idea-creation and selection.>
  
We decided to go for an independent approach to brainstorming that involved:
  1. Everyone reads the information from the spec
  2. People make independent notes on the spec, any important choices we need to make, any deliverables/tasks that need to be done, and their ideas of solutions
  3. These points are discussed in the team meeting
  
      a. Solutions are proposed.
      
      b. The final approach is decided by agreement within the team.
      
      c. If there is disagreement a vote is made and XXX acts as a tiebreaker.
      
      d. Discussions and decisions are all noted in the log.
  
Work allocation
---------------

<Approach used to allocate work to each team member.>
  
Work is allocated according to priority, preference, and skills/experience of the team members. Tasks are allocated during the team meeting.
  1. All the current priority tasks are listed
  2. Each team member expresses which task they would like to do from the task list in a first come - first serve priority
  3. Anyone with no preference is randomly assigned a task.
  4. If someone expresses they do not wish to do a task, it is resolved informally.
  
Each person is only assigned one task at a time.

Tools
-----

<Technologies, tools, or processes used to manage shared documents and work products.>

We used github as a central location where all documents would be stored. Any documents that had to be accessed/updated frequently by multiple members without clashing (e.g. updating the time log) were made on Google Drive and a link shared in the github's README file; this prevented conflicts as it can be updated by multiple people in real time (almost instantly). There would only be one member working on a file/task at a time so other conflicts would not happen.

Communication
-------------

<How communication amongst the team is managed, including the medium used and aproximate frequency.>

Our main communication was through a central WhatsApp group chat with all the team members, where we could informally talk about the project together (due to the remote working). We also used Microsoft Teams to communicate - we had scheduled meetings every day at about 2pm lasting as long as necessary (usually 1-2 hours). During the meetings we would:

  1. Review any tasks that had been allocated the previous day. 
      a. The team member(s) who contributed to the task would go through and explain their work, possibly highlighting any areas left out where they were unsure what was required.
      
      b. The other team member(s) would ask for clarification where necessary so that everyone understood the work.
      
      c. The team would highlight any issues, suggest improvements and/or the next steps for the task.
      
  2. Talk about any main concepts needing clarification within the team, and compile a list of remaining questions for the consultation.
  
  3. Consider any remaining tasks to be completed.
  
  4. Allocate those tasks to members with no current task.

After the meeting we worked independently, and uploaded any changes to documents to GitHub prior to the next meeting. Small queries would be discussed through the group chat, and more complex ones brought up in the meetings.

Sign-off
--------

<Process used to ensure that final documents have been prepared, checked, and that everyone has signed off on them.>

XXX was responsible for the sign-off of documents. Since all the documents were uploaded to GitHub, the team only needed to make sure updated versions of files were uploaded when complete. The documents available were compared with a check-list of the deliverables.
